	For our cs50 final project we created a web base app called Fooder.
	The purpose of Fooder is to provide harvard students with the opportunity to communally share food. The
	concept is simple, you post food that you will buy in the near future and want to split with others, and people in the college will be
	able to look at your order and decide whether they want to split that order with you.

		Before creating orders and committing to order you first have to go through register.
	In register you will be asked to provide basic information like a first name, last name, username and password,
	keep in mind that the password must contain one letter, number and symbol. You will also be asked to provide your
	venmo account so people can pay you as well as your email and phone number so people can contact you. Once you register,
	you will be asked for a confirmation code that will be sent to the email you used to register with. In order to
	successfully register you have to correctly submit the code that was sent to your email. After submitting the code
	you will be directed to the index page. Once you have made your account you can access your account again via login
	in which you will be asked to type in your username and password.

	Once one logs in you will presented with the index page. The index page will have all of the orders placed in the
	last two hours. We figured that it made sense to show orders for a limited time out of consideration for our users.
	That limit on this site is two hours. You will be presented with the username of various individuals and the description
	of the order. At the end you will have a commit button that will allow you to commit to an order. When the commit button
	is pressed you will be redirected to the commitments page where you will be able to see all the orders that you have committed
	to and the contact information of the individuals who originated that order. From there you can contact the individual and
	arrange pickup with them. This app allows you to have a food groupme that consists of all of Harvard. The availability of
	the contact information is why we need the site to be secure, thus the email verification. Your data is in good hands.
	If you wish to place an order you can go to the addorder page and there add the information necessary to complete an order,
	food type, description etcâ€¦. The other major feature that we have, to keep people accountable, is a ratings feature that allows
	you to rate your interactions with other users and a myorders page that allows you to see all of the orders you have place.
	Those are the ins and outs of our website.
